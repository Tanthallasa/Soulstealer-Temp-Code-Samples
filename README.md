# Soulstealer-Temp-Code-Samples
This game isn't finished yet and there isn't a current build for it
that accurately showcases more than a single aspect of it at a time. 
This repository will temporarily host some code samples and screenshots 
from the game. 

Soulstealer started out as Project BattleNetwork.
We set out to essentially clone the Megaman BattleNetwork series, and
then planned to diverge from the originals into our own game. As of now,
with a quarter of work on the project, we have successfully cloned the combat
gameplay and are working on altering the genre to our own style. 

The programming for this assignment has been divided 3 ways for the most part
1. Combat
2. Card Mechanics
3. Overworld
I've been the main programmer for the combat portion of the game, and have included
many of the relevant scripts and screenshots of the first two boss fights (with
heavily temporary art assets).
